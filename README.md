### What I Learned

Taking the time to write this project really taught me a lot. I enjoyed using javascript for a more streamlined way to access and manipulate the DOM. Being able to add and change HTML markup on the fly as the site is running was really a fun thing to see and accomplish with javascript. Learning how to access the local storage and that the difference between local and session storage is, I can see how this will be an important part of future projects. I also have a much better understanding of how timers work after making this project. Overall I had a lot of fun making this and I appreciate seeing how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, javascrpt and JSON work together to make an application.
